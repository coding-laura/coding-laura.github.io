![That GNP life.](/images/aboutme.png)

HOLA! I'm Laura - network engineer by trade and eclectic by birth.

Ready Router One is this little corner on the internet for me to share some of my
constantly growing technical knowledge and maybe a few life things I find inspiring.

*And yup, the title is play on words for Ready Player One. Great adventure book if you're looking for a recommendation.*
