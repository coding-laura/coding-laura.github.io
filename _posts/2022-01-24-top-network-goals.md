This was supposed to be a post about all the technologies I want to focus on this year. Then I started writing out my goals without giving much thought to all the content out there - and there is a lot. Thus the list became overwhelming. So instead, what follows is the top 3 areas I plan to develop in 2022.

*Level Up.*

## Network Design
The goal with network design is not whether I know how to configure a BGP architecture but whether I'm able to integrate other technologies - like compute and storage - into the network by understanding the new components and business needs, and to advice the best connectivity design.

***Learn Hyperconverged infrastructure***

   - Content to consume: 
       - ipspace.net
         - [HCI Deep Dive](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=HCI)

## Automation
My biggest obstacle when it comes to CI/CD is not the pipeline itself but the test cases that could enable a successful and error-free config change.

***Learn PyATS/Batfish***

   - Start small - validate an NTP change.
   - Implement virtualized lab (CML).
   - Content to consume: 
     - Packet Coders
       - [Network Testing with PyATS](packetcoders.io/network-testing-with-cisco-pyats/)
     - ipspace.net
       - [Network Automation Tools](https://my.ipspace.net/bin/list?id=NetTools)


## Cloud
Public Cloud is very prominent for most big companies and startups. This is my pick for a technology stack to stay current on to expand my career growth.

***Learn AWS Networking***

   - Content to consume: 
     - Udemy
       - [AWS Networking Design](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-networking-design/)

## Summary
Narrowing down my list took a bit of work. But I'm confident that by doing so I will have less clutter and multi-tasking to deal with, making my goals more in reach.

In 2022 I expect my learning path to challenge me as an engineer. We shall see in about 11 months where my plan and determination has taken me. And also, if anyone has any content they wish to share that will help me learn more about the goals I've set for myself, please feel free to share them.

I look forward to reading about what other engineers are taking up this year.
