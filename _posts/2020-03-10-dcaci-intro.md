Here's the deal, Cisco released their new Certs and I want to get the DCACI Specialization cert.  The thing is, I haven't been able to get started because [insert excuses here] .. I've been lazy. 

So I've gone ahead and populated the Exam Blueprint on a [Google Drive document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MzZJd29mLs6bqZKl-sLRQhsa-ykYdKSBcBFBQ9C8B-0/edit?usp=sharing) and decided to put some content into the $15/year domain I purchased for this blog with the end of making myself accountable. 

In the spirit of community and knowledge sharing I will publish what I've learned each week as a blog post.  And I encourage every one to reach out with feedback on how to better understand specific topics or if anything is lacking depth.  I look forward to hearing from you either on the comment section, via Twitter, or the Discord channels for studying (@Pretty on [theLANTamers](https://discordapp.com/channels/328935741994565643/328935741994565643) or [Cisco Study Group](https://discordapp.com/channels/328935741994565643/328935741994565643)).

*PS.* Anyone can copy the Blueprint spreadsheet and make it their own -- I actually got this [idea](https://overlaid.net/2014/12/29/the-path-to-ccie-data-center/) from [@overlaid](https://twitter.com/overlaid) a few years back and have used it for all my studies.
